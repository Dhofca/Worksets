# Translations

* No translations pipeline has been set up at this stage of the project. If you wish to translate Worksets to a specific language, please file an issue with Language as title and label it Translation.
* Worksets uses .po files for translation which can be edited in a normal text editor.
* There are approximately 40 lines of text to be translated in the application.
